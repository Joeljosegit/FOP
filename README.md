Description
Snoo.py is a simulation of friends, strangers and pets (puppies, cats, squirrels) in a backyard or inside the house together.
In which you are able to input how many humans, how many pets, what types of pets (cats, squirrels, puppies)
what type of humans (friends or strangers). In which they will run and interact with each-other moving across the two maps,
either a birds eye view of the back-yard or their house for a set number of 10 iterations.
This will be plotted to screen.

In order to be able to run the program have both creature.py and snoo.py in the same folder and in that folder's command line, 
do python3 snoo.py and follow the input statmeents based on what you want the simulation to do and or what charcter you want. then simulaiton will run for 10 iterations.
